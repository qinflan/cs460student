  <h1>RO.ME "3 DREAMS OF BLACK"</h1>

  <div class='demo'>

    <!-- TODO: REPLACE WITH A SCREENSHOT OF RO.ME -->
    <img id='screenshot' src='images/ROME_SS.png'>
    <p id='description'>
      Considering RO.ME was created by Chris Milk and some folks at Google in 2011, it clearly demonstrated the
      potential of WebGL for building complex and interactive 3D experiences in websites!
      Once HTML5 implemented the canvas element, this demo shows the capabilities of graphics without needing extra
      plugins. The interactive film takes you through vast landscapes and procedurally generated 3D animations.
      While not a game I think it's amazing that it shows you it's possible to create game like features and
      interactiveness in the browser with just WebGL. This is the key impact of this film, which is to showcase what
      WebGL can do, and inspire others to begin creating with it!

      TECH:
      <br />
      This interactive film uses Javascript, HTML, CSS, and most importantly WebGL.

        Menu WebGL Example</a>

      <br />
      Compared to the ROME experience, this WebGL example is a very different perspective on how the tech can be used.
      This site has an interactive 3D device that makes an otherwise mototonous task (checking boxes in a form) fun!
      This example shows that using 3D in your website even when it can be accomplished without can make it unique, and
      improve the UX design for viewers.

      SIGNIFICANCE (AI):
      <br />
      RO.ME 3 Dreams of Black was important because it demonstrated that rich, interactive 3D experiences could run
      directly in the browser using WebGL, without requiring plugins. It combined game-like interactivity with cinematic
      storytelling, showing the potential of web technologies for immersive experiences. The demo leveraged HTML5,
      JavaScript, CSS, and procedural generation to create complex, real-time graphics. Overall, it inspired developers
      to explore creative, interactive applications on the web.
